                            <li> WP1: MathDataLanguage <br>
                              Design the specification language for the 5-fold representation of MathData. The language should incorporate different elements,
                              satisfying the different aspects of the 5-fold representation. Moreover it should be concise (as small overhead as possible), porta-
                              ble (programming language and operating system agnostic), field agnostic (can be used for classes of objects that are not part of
                              the current plan), text based (allowing for version control tools to be used) . The deliverables are:
                              <ul>
                                <li>D.1.1: Blueprint of the specification language for the 5-fold representation (MathDataLanguage).</li>
                                <li>D.1.2: Prototype implementation of the MathDataLanguage used to represent small existing MathData libraries.</li>
                                <li>D.1.3: Benchmark the produced representations in terms of overhead, consistency, redundancy.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>

                              <li>WP2: MathData Repository and Public Server  <br>
                                The goal is to incorporate as many of the existing MathData libraries as possible. The size of the database is expected to be very
                                large and possibly techniques from Big Data will be needed. After the incorporation of the MathData from the sources mentioned
                                earlier, a publicly accessible server will be set up, making it the largest publicly available collection of mathematical data up to
                                date. The following deliverables are part of this WP:
                                  <ul>  <li>D.2.1: Implement a repository based on MathDataLanguage as described in the previous section.</li>
                                    <li>D.2.2: Import in the repository existing MathData object libraries/databases.</li>
                                    <li>D.2.3: Set up a publicly accessible server and promote it in the community.</li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>


                          <li>  WP3: Benchmark DescriptionLanguage - BDL <br>
                            The goal of WP3 is to create a language (BDL) that will allow to describe benchmarks in a way that is not area specific, it is reus-
                            able and makes the benchmarks reproducible. It will build on top of WP1, using both the experience gained and the MathData-
                            Language itself. The ultimate goal is to develop a standard and easy to learn language in order to allow researchers without com-
                            puter science expertise to easily design, execute and share their benchmarks. This will require to describe input data (using Math-
                            DataLanguage), datasets (logical groups of data), metrics, hardware and software platforms and features of both the input and
                            output data. Also, it is necessary to have a simple way to explain how a particular software will take data as input and how to inter-
                            pret its output. The following deliverables are part of WP3:
                            <ul> <li>D.3.1: Computational Platform Description Language</li>
                            <li>D.3.2: Task, Input, Output, Dataset, Feature, Metric description language.</li>
                          <li>  D.3.3: Design benchmarks based on BDL for large datasets.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                            <li>WP4: Benchmark System <br>
                            Using the Benchmark Description Language (BDL), design a software system that fully automates the execution of benchmarks
                            given a benchmark definition in BDL and the corresponding data in MathDataLanguage. Aspects of the system that are of great
                            importance are robustness and user-friendliness. It is important that non-experts can use the system with minimal effort. Also, it is
                            important that researchers can share their results. Given that the MathDataLanguage and the Benchmark Description Language
                            are both designed for robust sharing of objects, it will be possible to share the results, as well as the data to reproduce the results.
                            This functionality will be offered via a publicly accessible server. The following deliverables break down these tasks:
                            <ul>
                              <li>D.4.1: Implementation of the Benchmark Description Language into a Benchmarking System</li>
                            <li>D.4.2: Case Study for testing the Benchmarking System: Univariate Polynomial Solving</li>
                            <li>D.4.3: A public server allowing the sharing of benchmarks between researchers.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                            <li>WP5: API + interfaces to Mathematical Software <br>
                            The MathDataLibrary will be accessible via the public server of WP2. Nevertheless, it is important that the database offers inter-
                            faces to popular mathematical software. Especially, to the widely used computer algebra system Sage. Apart from that, a Python
                            interface should be provided so that easy prototyping/scripting using data from the MathDataLibrary will be facilitated. Finally, a
                            standard used by various computer algebra system is OpenMath. A number of EU H2020 funded projects, such as Open-
                            DreamKit, are supporting the effort of making OpenMath a standard for the communication between computer algebra systems
                            and it is only natural that a MathDataLibrary should contribute in this effort. The following three deliverables reflect the interfaces
                            to be developed:
                            <ul>
                              <li>D.5.1: Python interface</li>
                            <li>D.5.2: Sage Interface</li>
                            <li>D.5.3: OpenMath Interface</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

				<h2>Project Description</h2>
	            <p>
                The scientific community produces constantly data that is used for various purposes.
                Most of this data is discarded after used for a particular purpose
                and produced from scratch next time it is needed.
                This phenomenon is even more common in the math community.
                </p><p>
                Mathematical software treats data as a byproduct and only rarely as a first class citizen in the world of mathematical research.
                Nevertheless, modern mathematics research involves large amount of data,
                experimental or in the form of using well defined mathematical structures.
                In recent years, especially through the work of the Big Data community,
                the importance of data in research has been highlighted.
                Although the Big Data community developed an excellent toolbox for scalar/numerical data,
                there is no similar toolbox for graphs, polynomials and structured mathematical data in general.
                This lack of appropriate tools hinders research in mathematics,
                but also impedes the use of state-of-the-art mathematics by industry.
                </p><p>

                 In short, each time we need to use some data, we reinvent the wheel.
                 It is of great importance to be able to efficiently store, reuse and share mathematical data,
                 as well as analyze it in modern ways.
                 On the other hand, the lack of an easy and general enough way of performing benchmarks of
                 mathematical software, leads to the ad hoc development of benchmarking tools to be used
                 only once by only one research team.
                 The benchmarks are not reproducible and in general not usable by other researchers.
                 Except for the waste of resources in academia, this is a very big obstacle for industry to adopt new methods,
                  since the cost of evaluating them is too high.
                </p><p>
                In recent years, a lot of effort has been put by the Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM) community concerning the
                representation of mathematics.
                 Unfortunately, the data of the MKM systems is mathematical theories, i.e., axioms, definitions and theorems.
                 Thus we cannot directly use the tools developed in order to treat mathematical data (MathData).
                </p><p>
                 At the same time, the need for reproducible research is constantly growing.
                 From journals to courses, one can observe the recent increase in the interest on reproducible research.
                 A number of web services offering to store datasets are available, but they focus mostly on scalar data.
                 Nevertheless, despite the lack of the right tools, there are various projects intended to produce databases
                 of mathematical objects.
                 The efforts are fragmented and each project adopts different policies and representation principles.
                 The lack of a uniform way to represent, exchange and store data in a robust way hinders the usability of
                  those databases.
              </p><p>

                  Part of the need for the present project lies exactly in the surprisingly bad shape the state-of-the-art
                  solutions are, for such an important problem.
                  This project is about developing a standard representation for storing and sharing MathData,
                  in the form of the description language MathDataLanguage.
                  By providing a unified and publicly accessible MathDataLibrary, we expect that the communities of both
                  mathematicians and computer scientists will embrace the new standard and take advantage of it.
              </p><p>
                  Building on this new data representation, we develop a fully automated system for performing benchmarks.
                  The benchmarks are shareable, reusable and reproducible, because they are expressed in a
                  descriptive language that is independent of the scientific area, the hardware platform or the software used.
                  This way, we can reproduce all the tasks necessary in any given environment fully automatically.
              </p><p>

                  This breaks the barrier that for many scientists, who are not familiar with computer science,
                  prevents them from performing benchmarks and sharing their experimental results.
                  Following the paradigm of web platforms for sharing hardware benchmarks,
                   we provide a web platform for sharing software benchmarks.
                   Such a platform would be useful for industrial users who wish to evaluate new software solutions
                   without the overhead cost of performing a resource consuming evaluation of the available solutions.
               </p><p>

                   The  importance of this project lies on widening the community of
researchers that will be able to share their MathData and run benchmarks on them.
This project proposes an easy way for academic
and industrial researchers to share their MathData with the rest of the community.
This addresses the recently emerging request for
reproducible research on one hand and help the community save resources on the other.
Resources that are till now wasted in the
reproduction of the same data, due to lack of collaboration and of a centrally and easily searchable and accessible repository. The
expected impact in the communities of Symbolic Computation, Combinatorics and Algorithmic Mathematics in general is very big,
starting a new way of collaboration potentially leading to groundbreaking results that cannot be achieved without the proposed
collaboration tools. The final long term aim is to create a community of users of the MathDataLanguage. Using tools from Big Data
and Deep Learning is very promising, but currently impossible for most areas of mathematics. Adopting a way to represent MathData,
store, share and reuse them will help mathematical research and will boost
the collaboration of academic math research with industry and make it easier for industry to fully exploit the advances in MathData
research.
