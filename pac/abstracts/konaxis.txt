Based on the computation of the so called predicted polytope $Q$,
containing the Newton polytope $P$ of the implicit equation,
implicitization of a parametric hypersurface is reduced
to computing the nullspace of a numeric interpolation matrix.
Our approach predicts $Q$ by exploiting the sparseness of the
given parametric equations and of the implicit polynomial,
without being affected by the presence of any base points.

We describe two approaches in constructing the interpolation matrix.
The main method, given a superset of the monomials in the implicit polynomial,
constructs the matrix by evaluating these monomials at points on the object.
The second method uses the linear relations between the implicit and the parametric
expressions of the normal to the curve or surface at any given point and
works either with parameterized objects or with objects given by a
point cloud along with normals at the points.
The matrix dimension is not smaller than the main method, but the number of sample points
required to construct it can be reduced up to one third.

When the predicted polytope $Q$ contains $P$ as a Minkowski summand,
we improve the efficiency of the method by employing Minkowski decomposition
to detect the Minkowski summand of $Q$ relevant to implicitization.
We design and implement in Sage a new, public domain, practical, potentially generalizable
and worst-case optimal algorithm for Minkowski decomposition in 3D based on integer linear programming.

Finally, we study how the interpolation matrix expresses the implicit equation as
a matrix determinant, which is useful for certain operations such as ray shooting,
and how it can be used to reduce some key geometric predicates on the hypersurface,
namely membership and sidedness for given query points, to simple numerical operations on the matrix,
without need to develop the implicit equation.
