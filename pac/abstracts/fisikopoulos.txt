We propose the first algorithm for enumerating all combinatorial types
of 2-level (a.k.a. compressed) polytopes of a given dimension d, and
provide complete experimental results for d<=6. Our approach is based
on new findings on 2-level polytopes, also presented here. In
particular, we introduce the notion of a simplicial core, which allows
us to reduce the problem to the enumeration of the closed sets of a
discrete closure operator, along with some convex hull computations
and isomorphism tests.
